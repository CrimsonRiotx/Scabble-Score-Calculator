# Scrabble-Score-Calculator

Project for calculating a word's score in scrabble. Initial problem comes from https://exercism.org/tracks/java/exercises/scrabble-score

This calculator takes in an input and checks if it is a single-word (not containing spaces, symbols, or numbers). 
After doing so, it will calculate your scrabble score and return it back to you.

[UPDATE 12/12/2022] Scrabble Score Calculator now checks your word against a dictionary to confirm whether the word is valid or not. This can be run in your system's terminal with no prior setup.
